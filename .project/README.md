# Project Management

This folder contains project planning, tracking, and documentation.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Accumulating Backlog

**Collecting Needs**:
- **Research & Analysis**: Running research reports, web searches, collecting data to understand what needs to be done
- **During Development**: Issues identified while running/writing code
- **External PM**: Requirements from external project management systems

**Creating Epics**:
- Capture outcomes and goals
- Note known pieces of work (details come later during decomposition)

---

### 2. Prioritization

1. **User prioritizes** using their own methods
2. **Update BACKLOG.md** via `/_my_status` command - reorganize, set priorities
3. **Epic decomposition** (before or after prioritization, e.g., to estimate effort):
   - Organize into **parts** if needed (logical groupings)
   - Break down into **items** with numbering (e.g., `4.2` = Part 4, Item 2)

---

### 3. Epic Execution

Iterate through items in the epic. Each item runs the standard pipeline of `/_my_*` stages.

**For the canonical, current flow and when/how to use each stage, run `/_my_pipeline`** (installed
with claude-pack). This README does not carry its own copy of the sequence — `/_my_pipeline` is the
single source, so it can't go stale here.

**As the epic progresses**: Add or insert new items as you learn more. Follow the same process for each.

---

### 4. Epic Cleanup

1. **Check** for all completed active items
2. **Move items** to `completed/` using `git mv`, prefixed with date stamp (e.g., `git mv .project/active/item_name .project/completed/20251223_item_name`)
3. **Move epic** to `completed/` using `git mv` with date stamp (e.g., `git mv .project/backlog/epic_name.md .project/completed/20251223_epic_name.md`)
4. **Update docs**: `CURRENT_WORK.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, and `completed/CHANGELOG.md`

## Item Numbering

Items within an epic use hierarchical numbering:
- `1`, `2`, `3` - Simple sequential items
- `4.1`, `4.2`, `4.3` - Items within Part 4
- Parts group related items logically
