"""Verify a sealed package against its recorded ``PackageContract`` (Item 9 / D4, D5, D7).

Stdlib-only — ``hashlib``, ``json``, ``pathlib``, ``re`` — imports nothing from
sysml-codegen or any other project package. This is the canonical source; it is emitted
verbatim as ``contracts/verify.py`` inside every generated package (INV-8), so a teax
environment can verify a package it loaded without sysml-codegen installed (B3).

The verification algorithm is generic: it reads only the seal's self-description (its
recorded coverage policy, hashes, and versions), never the model, so this one small module
serves any generated package.
